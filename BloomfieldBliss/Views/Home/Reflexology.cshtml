            <p>Reflexology is the technique of applying gentle thumb or finger pressure to specific points on the hands and feet. The theory underlying reflexology is that the organs, nerves, glands and other parts of the body are connected to points or “reflexes” on the feet and hands.</p>
            <p>Reflexology is a therapy that can be received by anyone at any age. In some circumstances it is advised not to receive a treatment and therefore it is best to phone to check. Reflexology does not claim to cure or diagnose any ailments. It is a very individual treatment which is tailored to each client, taking into account both physical and non-physical factors that might be affecting their wellbeing. Reflexology works for some people, but not for others. The best thing is to try it.</p>
